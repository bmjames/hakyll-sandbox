# Hakyll (and Clay) sandbox

A Cabal project for building a site with [Hakyll] [1] in a sandbox.

It uses [Clay] [2] as a CSS preprocessor. I have simply transcribed Hakyll's default stylesheet into the Clay language.

Everything else is as generated by `hakyll-init`.

## Requirements

You will need [Cabal] [3] >= 1.20. (The site compiler builds the stylesheets with `cabal exec runghc`; they are not part of the Cabal project, in order that that you can change the stylesheets without rebuilding this project.)

The latest version of Cabal can be installed by first installing the [Haskell Platform] [4], then running `cabal update` followed by `cabal install cabal-install`.

## Getting started

Start by creating a sandbox to avoid Cabal Hell: `cabal sandbox init`

To build the site, run `cabal run build`, `cabal run watch` etc.
